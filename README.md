<h1>The Hirst Painting Project using Turtle Module in Python</h1>

<p>This project is an implementation of the popular Hirst painting using Python's Turtle module. The Hirst painting is a well-known piece of contemporary art created by Damien Hirst in 1988. It consists of a large canvas with rows and columns of circles filled with various colors. This project aims to replicate the Hirst painting using Python's Turtle module.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>To run this project, you will need Python 3.x and the Turtle module installed on your system. You can install the Turtle module by running the following command:</p>

<code>pip install turtle</code>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>To run the project, simply run the <code>hirst_painting.py</code> file using Python.</p>

<code>python hirst_painting.py</code>

<p>The program will prompt you to enter the number of dots you want in a row. Once you enter the number, the program will generate a canvas with rows and columns of circles filled with random colors.</p>

<p>You can also adjust the size of the dots, the gap between dots, and the number of rows by modifying the variables <code>DOT_SIZE</code>, <code>GAP_SIZE</code>, and <code>NUM_ROWS</code>, respectively, in the <code>hirst_painting.py</code> file.</p>
